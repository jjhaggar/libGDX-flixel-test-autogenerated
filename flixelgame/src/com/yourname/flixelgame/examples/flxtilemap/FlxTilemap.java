/**
 * Flixel's FlxTilemap class was inspired by old video games,
 * in which the environment was constructed using a grid of square "tiles".
 * Each grid cell gets a number, or index, which refers to a particular square graphic.
 * That tile graphic is then placed at the appropriate grid number.
 * Tilemaps have many advantages: it is easy to figure out what tiles should be drawn on screen,
 * what tiles an object overlaps, and what special properties each tile might have.
 * Flixel also includes some built-in algorithms for automatically placing wall
 * tiles and floor tiles based on a simple binary (1s and 0s) array of tile data.
 * It is a simple system with a lot of flexibility, which makes it perfect for rapid prototyping.
